Machine learning Model Practice and submitted assignment
Project Overview
Objective: Predict the monthly closing price of Yes Bank stock.

Steps Taken:

Data Loading and Cleaning:
Loaded the dataset and created a DataFrame.
Performed data cleaning and handled outliers appropriately.
Feature Engineering and Preparation:
Extracted month and year from the 'Date' column.
One-hot encoded the categorical features.
Exploratory Data Analysis:
Visualized the distribution of 'Close' prices.
Analyzed the time series plot to observe trends and patterns.
Performed seasonal decomposition to understand the trend, seasonality, and residuals.
Modeling:
Implemented Linear Regression and evaluated its performance.
Implemented Random Forest and evaluated its performance.
Analyzed feature importance from the models.
Results
Linear Regression:
MSE: 0.0099 Cross-validated RMSE: 161006705.2099 +/- 322013410.2382 Residual analysis showed a normal bell curve.

Random Forest:
MSE: 0.0196

Moving Forward Based on the analysis and results, Random Forest provided a reasonable MSE but not necessarily better than Linear Regression in terms of MSE.

Model Improvement :
Hyperparameter Tuning:
Perform hyperparameter tuning for both Linear Regression and Random Forest using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search.

Additional Models:
Consider other models such as Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, or LSTM for time series forecasting.

Feature Engineering:
Explore additional features that might capture more nuances in the data, such as lagged features, rolling averages, or interaction terms.
